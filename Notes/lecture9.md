## Continuity and Differentiation
If f'(a) exists then f is differentiable at x = 0.
If f'(a) is differentiable at a then f(a) is continuous at x = a.

lim <sub>x -> a</sub> (f(x) - f(a)) = lim<sub>x -> a</sub> [(f(x) - f(a))/(x - a))(x - a)]

= 0

If f(x) is continuous at x = a, then f(x) may not be differentiable at x = a.
For example consider f(x) = |a|.

lim<sub>h -> 0<sup>+</sup></sub> f'(0) = 1

lim<sub>h -> 0<sup>-</sup></sub> f'(0) = -1

Therefore f'(x) is not continuous at x = a and f(x) is not continuous at x = a.

## Rules of Differentiation
+ d/dx c = 0, where c is a constant
+ d/dx x<sup>n</sup> = nx<sup>n - 1</sup>, where n is a constant
+ d/dx (f(x) &pm g(x)) = d/dx f(x) &pm d/dx g(x)
+ d/dx ae<sup>ax</sup> = e<sup>ax</sup>, where a is a constant
+ d/dx cf(x) = c(d/dx f(x)), where c is a constant
